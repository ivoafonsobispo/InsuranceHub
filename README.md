# InsuranceHub

## Project Description

The project aimed to develop an enterprise-level application that optimizes the management of insurance claims for insured assets. The application integrates with insurance company APIs to access policy details and manage incidents associated with them. It provides features such as incident registration, attachment of files, status tracking, websockets and pdf generation. The application also includes business logic analysis to validate incident coverage and allows clients to select certified repair services.

- **Repair Service Integration:** Clients can select certified repair services, and the selected service receives a message with a hyperlink to the incident.
- **Web Services:** The application provides web services for easy integration with insurance company enterprise applications.
- **Additional Features:** Import data from CSV or Excel files, responsive theme, internal messaging and notification system, file compression, and pagination.

## Tools Used

- **Java:** Main programming language for back-end development.
- **Docker:** Containerization and deployment of the application.
- **Vue.js:** Front-end development and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** Server-side scripting and building scalable network applications.
